# Guard::Delayed

Guard::Delayed automatically starts/stops/restarts delayed_job

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continuing.

Install the gem:

    gem install guard-delayed

or add it to your Gemfile (inside your development and/or test group):

    gem 'guard-delayed'

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

    guard init delayed

## Usage

Please read [Guard usage doc](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

I suggest you put the delayed guard definition *before* your test/rspec guard if your tests depend on it
being active.

## Guardfile

    guard 'delayed', :environment => 'development' do
      watch(%r{^app/(.+)\.rb})
    end

Ideas for this gem came from [Guard::WEBrick](http://github.com/fnichol/guard-webrick).

## Note

I originally called this `guard-delayed_job` but had all sorts of unexpected behaviour when trying to build the gem.
After much fruitless investigation it appeared that the underscore was the problem, so I renamed it to `guard-delayed`.
Anybody else encountered this? Let me know if you have. Thanks in advance.
