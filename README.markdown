# Guard::Delayed

Guard::Delayed automatically starts/stops/restarts delayed_job

## Install

Please be sure to have [Guard](http://github.com/guard/guard) installed before continuing.

Add it to your Gemfile (inside your development and/or test group):

    gem 'guard-delayed'

Add guard definition to your Guardfile by running this command:

    guard init delayed

## Usage

Please read [Guard usage doc](http://github.com/guard/guard#readme).

I suggest you put the delayed guard definition *before* your test/rspec guard if your tests depend on it being active.

## Guardfile

    guard 'delayed', :environment => 'development' do
      watch(%r{^app/(.+)\.rb})
    end
